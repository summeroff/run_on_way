### Brief Overview:
Aleksey, a quiet and reserved IT worker, lives a life of deliberate invisibility, shaped by his grandmother’s mantra of staying unnoticed. When a neighbor’s suicide disrupts his routine, cryptic notes and eerie encounters begin to unravel his carefully maintained solitude. Fleeing to a remote town for a fresh start, he finds temporary peace—until mysterious figures, threatening messages, and a vanishing dog drag him into a spiraling nightmare. As reality blurs with paranoia, Aleksey fights to protect his sanity and uncover the forces stalking him, only to face a chilling intervention that questions the boundaries of his mind.
