### Brief Overview
Aleksey, a reserved IT worker shaped by his grandmother’s mantra of staying unnoticed, lives a life of deliberate invisibility. When a neighbor’s suicide shatters his routine, cryptic notes and eerie encounters begin to unravel his solitude. Seeking escape, he flees to a remote town, finding fleeting peace—until mysterious figures, threatening messages, and the disappearance of his dog plunge him into a spiraling nightmare. As reality blurs with paranoia, Aleksey battles to protect his sanity and confront the forces stalking him, only to face a chilling intervention that leaves the boundaries of his mind in question.
